            The school provides a curriculum which is broadly balanced. It aims also to develop pupils spiritual, moral, social and cultural development. We aim to foster the development of skills, interests and attitudes that are appropriate to the intellectual, physical, emotional and social stages of all children, taking into account the individual child’s stage of maturity and ability.
            Literacy and Numeracy are taught daily, Science, RE and music are taught weekly alongside PE. The school has recently embarked upon the International Primary Curriculum in which Science, Technology, Art, History and Geography are taught through individual units/topics on a half termly / termly basis. ICT / E-Learning is used as a tool for learning rather than taught in a discrete manner as a separate subject. This is taught as a cross-curricular element of study         The School Curriculum is also enriched through educational visits and visitors coming into school. Residential visits are available to several localities for pupils in Years 2, 4 and 6​​.
