                Arden Primary School aims to provide every child with an excellent educational experience, which is enjoyable, stimulating and safe enabling them to reach their full potential. We are a small school, but we have big ideas and do not set limits on what our children can aspire to and achieve

                We care about our pupils and want them to feel safe and supported. We ensure our school is friendly, welcoming, active, vibrant and inclusive. We take our safeguarding responsibilities very seriously and foster a safeguarding culture which goes above and beyond our statutory duties
